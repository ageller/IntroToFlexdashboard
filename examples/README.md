# A progressive set of examples

These example are numbered in order such that examples with larger numbers build on those with smaller numbers.  The final example (`example5.Rmd`) is identical to `../flexdashboard_example.Rmd`, and a live version is available [here](https://ageller.shinyapps.io/flexdashboard_example/).

These files should be compiled using R Studio and by clicking the "Run Document" button in the upper left.
